# FileTree

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.0 and developed using Node v22.16.0.
You can use the same Node version to run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

To get the required data in the component, you need a local web server running that serves the required JSON response. 
Clone the repo: [simple-express-server](https://github.com/awdebruijn/simple-express-server) and follow the instructions how to get it up and running.  

## How to run this project

First install the dependencies using ``npm install`` from the root of the project.

To run the project start the local dev server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You can try and test the solution at this URL.
The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

This project contains some unit tests, but they do not cover 100% of the code due to time restrictions. To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
